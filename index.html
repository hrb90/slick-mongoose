        You can draw a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph">planar graph</a> on the canvas.
        Draw a new vertex by clicking an empty part of the graph; draw an edge by clicking two existing vertices.
        Try to keep all the edges connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you draw a graph and then click the "Color" button, it will (likely) add some extra, blue edges to the graph, and then color the graph with five colors so no vertices connected by an edge have the same color.
        If there is a graph that the page won't color, or the graph is miscolored, please <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hrb90/slick-mongoose/issues/new">open a new issue</a> :). Thanks again!
