          Draw a map on a piece of paper. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">famous theorem</a>
          that you can color the regions with only four colors so that no two touching regions have the same color.
          This theorem is very hard to prove without a computer.

        <p>
          However, if you relax the statement of the theorem to five colors, then simple proofs are known.
          This page presents an algorithm based on <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=184192">Thomassen's proof</a> of the stronger "5-choosability" theorem.
