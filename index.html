      <p>
        You can draw a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph">planar graph</a> on the canvas.
        Draw a new vertex by clicking an empty part of the graph; draw an edge by clicking two existing vertices.
        Try to keep all the edges connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you draw a graph and then click the "triangulate" button, it will add blue edges to the graph so that all inner faces are triangles.
        If there are faces that aren't triangles, or there are crossing edges, please let me know in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hrb90/slick-mongoose/issues/1">this issue</a>.
        Please include the log of how your graph was constructed (open up the developer tools console and type "graphLog").
      </p>
      <p>
        If you run into any other problems, please <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hrb90/slick-mongoose/issues/new">open a new issue</a> :). Thanks again!
