          Draw a map on a piece of paper. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">famous theorem</a>
          that you can color the regions with only four colors so that no two regions that share a border have the same color.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Equivalently, you can consider the "dual graph": draw a vertex for each region, and an edge between regions that share a border.
          This dual graph is "planar"; its edges do not cross.
          Then you can color the vertices of the dual graph with four colors so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This theorem is very hard to prove; in fact, the only known proofs require computer assistance to check a huge number of cases, and there is no easily understandable algorithm for four-coloring a planar map.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you relax the statement of the theorem to five colors, then simple proofs are known, as are simple algorithm.
          Here, I present a visualization of an algorithm based on <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=184192">Thomassen's proof</a> of the stronger "5-choosability" theorem.
